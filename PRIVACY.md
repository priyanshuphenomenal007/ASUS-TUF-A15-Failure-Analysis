# Privacy \& Redaction Policy

This repository intentionally redacts personally identifiable information (PII)—such as full serial numbers, emails, and phone numbers—from all public-facing evidence to protect personal privacy.



The manufacturer, ASUS, is already in possession of all original, unredacted service documents and communications containing this information through our official, private email correspondence. The redactions in this public repository are solely for the purpose of ensuring the privacy and safety of the individuals involved.



All artifacts and evidence supporting this analysis are otherwise provided in their entirety within this public repository. The goal of this project is full public transparency.
