# Failure Analysis â€” ASUS TUF Gaming A15 (FA506ICB)
**Report Date:** 2025-08-18 | **System S/N:** N7NRCX07W******304

> **Scope:** The evidence contained within this repository demonstrates repeated, critical system failures, including unclean shutdowns and the intermittent disappearance of the dedicated GPU, immediately following a clean OS installation by an official technician. These observations strongly suggest a recurring, systemic hardware fault.

## Methodology & Tools Used

The evidence in this repository was collected using standard, first-party Microsoft Windows tools to ensure authenticity and objectivity.

1.  **Raw logs** were exported via `wevtutil epl` and filtered into CSVs via `Get-WinEvent`.
2.  **System and driver states** were captured using `systeminfo`, `dxdiag`, and `Get-CimInstance`.
3.  **Power and battery health reports** were generated using `powercfg /energy` and `/batteryreport`.
4.  **File integrity** can be verified using the `CHECKSUMS_SHA256.csv` file in the root directory.
