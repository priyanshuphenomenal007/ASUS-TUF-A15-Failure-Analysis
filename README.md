# Failure Analysis — ASUS TUF Gaming A15 (FA506ICB)
**Report Date:** [redacted-phone] | **System S/N:** N7NRCX07W******304

> **Scope:** This repository documents a pattern of chronic and evolving critical system failures, with verifiable **critical events logged on five consecutive days** immediately following a clean OS installation by an official technician. The data includes raw XML reports, video of a degrading GPU, and HWiNFO logs that rule out overheating, which irrefutably proves a systemic hardware fault.
