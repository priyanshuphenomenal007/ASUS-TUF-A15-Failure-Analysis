# Service Review Brief â€” ASUS TUF A15 (FA506ICB)
**Prepared:** 2025-08-19 | **Owner:** Priyanshu Kumar

## Summary
- **A complete service failure has been documented:**
  - An initial, detailed report with technical logs proving a hardware fault was sent on Aug 16.
  - The on-site technician dismissed this evidence, diagnosed a "software issue," and performed a failed Windows reinstall.
  - A follow-up email from ASUS on Aug 18 revealed that a **"required part has been received,"** contradicting the on-site diagnosis and proving a lack of transparency with the customer.
- This service failure is in response to a **systemic hardware fault**, proven by multiple BSODs (`BugcheckCode 159`), hard freezes, and the live, real-time degradation of the NVIDIA GPU from a non-responsive "zombie" state to a complete hardware disconnection.
- HWiNFO logs confirm all failures occur under normal thermal conditions, ruling out overheating.

## Interpretation
The evidence proves a catastrophic failure of not only the product's hardware but also of the company's entire diagnostic and service process. The internal diagnosis (requiring a part) and the on-site resolution (software reinstall) were contradictory, and the true nature of the fault was not communicated transparently.

## Objective
The objective of this brief and its associated repository is to serve as a public, evidence-based case study of a recurring hardware fault and a negligent service process.
