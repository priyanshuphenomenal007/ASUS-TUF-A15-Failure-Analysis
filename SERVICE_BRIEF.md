# Service Review Brief — ASUS TUF A15 (FA506ICB)
**Prepared:** [redacted-phone] | **Owner:** Priyanshu Kumar

## Summary
- **A complete service failure has been documented:**
  - An initial, detailed report with technical logs was repeatedly ignored.
  - The on-site technician's "software" diagnosis was proven incorrect by immediate and recurring hardware failures.
  - A final email from the service manager on Aug 22 proves a total breakdown in internal communication and attempts to falsely rewrite the case history.
- This service failure is in response to a **systemic hardware fault**, proven by multiple BSODs (`BugcheckCode 159`), the failure of both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, and video of live hardware degradation.
- HWiNFO logs confirm all failures occur under normal thermal conditions.

## Interpretation
The evidence proves a catastrophic failure of not only the product's hardware but also of the company's entire diagnostic, communication, and service process.

## Objective
The objective of this brief and its associated repository is to serve as a public, evidence-based case study of a recurring hardware fault and a negligent service process.
