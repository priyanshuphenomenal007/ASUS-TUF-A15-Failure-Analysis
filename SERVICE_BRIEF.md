# Service Review Brief — ASUS TUF A15 (FA506ICB)
**Prepared:** [redacted-phone] | **Owner:** Priyanshu Kumar

## Summary
- **A complete diagnostic failure has been proven:** A signed ASUS Service Report from Aug 16 officially concluded the **"unit working fine"** after an OS reinstall. This was immediately followed by a cascade of **critical hardware failures on five consecutive days**.
- **Multiple, Evolving Failure Modes:** The evidence includes recurring **unclean shutdowns** (`BugcheckCode 159`), critical failures of **NVIDIA's `NVDisplay.Container.exe`**, and the **live degradation of the dGPU** from an unresponsive "zombie" state to a complete hardware disconnection.
- **HWiNFO logs** confirm all failures occur under normal thermal conditions, definitively ruling out overheating.

## Interpretation
The continuous, multi-day pattern of evolving hardware failures on a pristine operating system, immediately following a service visit that officially declared the unit "fine," overwhelmingly points to a systemic hardware fault and a negligent service and diagnostic process.

## Objective
The objective of this brief and its associated repository is to serve as a public, evidence-backed case study of a recurring hardware fault and a failed service process.
