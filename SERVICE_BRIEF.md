# Service Review Brief — ASUS TUF A15 (FA506ICB)
**Prepared:** [redacted-phone] | **Owner:** Priyanshu Kumar

## Summary
- **A pattern of chronic instability has been documented:** The system has suffered from **critical failures on five consecutive days** (Aug 16, 17, 18, 19, & 20) immediately following a clean OS installation by an official ASUS technician.
- **Multiple, Evolving Failure Modes:** The evidence includes recurring **unclean shutdowns** (`BugcheckCode 159`), critical failures of **NVIDIA's `NVDisplay.Container.exe`**, and the **live degradation of the dGPU** from an unresponsive "zombie" state to a complete hardware disconnection.
- **HWiNFO logs** confirm all failures occur under normal thermal conditions, definitively ruling out overheating.

## Interpretation
The continuous, multi-day pattern of evolving hardware failures on a pristine operating system overwhelmingly points to a systemic and actively failing hardware component on the motherboard. The service process has been proven to be completely ineffective.

## Objective
The objective of this brief and its associated repository is to serve as a public, evidence-based case study of a recurring hardware fault and a negligent service process.
