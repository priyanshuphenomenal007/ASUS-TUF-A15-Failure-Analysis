# Service Review Brief — ASUS TUF A15 (FA506ICB)
**Prepared:** [redacted-phone] | **Owner:** Priyanshu Kumar

## Summary
- **A definitive "Hardware error" was logged by Windows on Aug 19 at 3:56 AM.** A live HWiNFO log running at the moment of failure provides irrefutable proof that the system was operating under safe thermal conditions (GPU at 49°C), completely ruling out overheating. The GPU was missing from Device Manager after this event.
- This event is the culmination of a multi-day pattern of systemic hardware failures, including a `BugcheckCode 159` BSOD, critical crashes of both ASUS and NVIDIA software, and the live, real-time degradation of the NVIDIA GPU.
- This is compounded by a complete service failure, where an initial, detailed report was dismissed and a secret, contradictory diagnosis was made internally, proving a lack of transparency.

## Interpretation
The evidence proves a catastrophic failure of not only the product's hardware but also of the company's entire diagnostic and service process. The final HWiNFO log provides undeniable proof that the hardware is failing under normal operating conditions.

## Objective
The objective of this brief and its associated repository is to serve as a public, evidence-based case study of a recurring hardware fault and a negligent service process.
