# Service Review Brief — ASUS TUF A15 (FA506ICB)
**Prepared:** [redacted-phone] | **Owner:** Priyanshu Kumar

## Summary
- **A complete diagnostic and service failure has been proven:** After an initial failed service on Aug 16, communications from the technician on Aug 18 prove the company was still focused on an irrelevant Wi-Fi card replacement. This incorrect diagnosis was formally refuted on Aug 19 when a complete, evidence-backed GitHub report was presented to the technician and escalated to his seniors.
- **The ignored evidence includes:** A definitive "Hardware error" logged by Windows while under live thermal monitoring (GPU at 49°C), multiple BSODs (`BugcheckCode 159`), and video of the GPU degrading in real-time from a "zombie" state to a complete hardware disconnection.

## Interpretation
The company's persistent focus on an incorrect solution, despite the escalating hardware failures, demonstrates a service and diagnostic process that is fundamentally broken and incapable of identifying complex, systemic faults.

## Objective
The objective of this brief and its associated repository is to serve as a public, evidence-based case study of a recurring hardware fault and a willfully negligent service process.
