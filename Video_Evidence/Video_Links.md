### 4. Live Hardware Degradation (Aug 18)
The following two videos, captured one hour apart without a system reboot, document the live degradation of the NVIDIA GPU from a non-responsive "zombie" state to a complete hardware disconnection.

- **Part 1: GPU Unresponsive State ("Zombie Mode")**
  This video shows the GPU is detected by Windows but has 0% utilization in Task Manager and cannot be activated by ASUS's own Armoury Crate software.
